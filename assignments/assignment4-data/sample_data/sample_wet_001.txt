Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. 
        It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, 
        identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms 
        build a mathematical model based on training data in order to make predictions or decisions 
        without being explicitly programmed to do so.
        
        The process typically involves collecting data, preparing and cleaning the data, choosing a model, 
        training the algorithm, evaluating the model, parameter tuning and prediction. There are several 
        types of machine learning including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Python is a programming language that was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. 
        It has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Python is known 
        for its simple and readable syntax, which makes it easy for beginners to learn.
        
        Python can be used for many different types of applications including web development, 
        data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation. Many companies use Python including 
        Google, Netflix, and Instagram.

The transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017, has revolutionized 
        natural language processing. The key innovation was the attention mechanism, which allows 
        the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each output token.
        
        The attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of all input representations, where the weights 
        are determined by the compatibility between a query and key vectors. This allows the model to 
        capture long-range dependencies more effectively than recurrent neural networks.
