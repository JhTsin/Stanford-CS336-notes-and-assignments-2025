1. Activation Checkpointing: Trade compute for memory by recomputing activations during
   backward pass instead of storing them. This can reduce memory by 50-80%, allowing
   smaller batch sizes. The additional compute cost is typically 25-33% but enables
   training much larger models or smaller batches (Chen et al. 2016).

2. Pipeline Parallelism: Split the model across devices temporally, allowing multiple
   microbatches to be processed simultaneously. This reduces the effective batch size
   per device while maintaining throughput through temporal parallelism. Optimal
   microbatch size follows: num_microbatches = num_pipeline_stages for best efficiency
   (Huang et al. 2019).

3. Sequence Parallelism: Shard activations along the sequence dimension in addition to
   tensor parallelism. This reduces activation memory proportionally to the sequence
   parallel degree, enabling smaller batch sizes (Korthikanti et al. 2022).

4. Communication Overlap: Overlap gradient communication with backward computation using
   bucketed gradients and asynchronous all-reduce operations. This reduces the
   communication bottleneck that otherwise requires larger batches for efficiency
   (Rajbhandari et al. 2020).

5. Mixed Precision Optimizations: Use FP16/BF16 for activations and gradients while
   keeping master weights in FP32. Advanced techniques like loss scaling and gradient
   clipping enable stable training with reduced memory footprint (Micikevicius et al. 2018).
